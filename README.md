# LSPosed Framework

**目前状态：似乎正常**

在出现成熟的LSPosed分支或替代前临时使用。我不是专业的Android开发者，这个仓库仅包含兼容新Android的必要修改（来自其他开发者），以保留与原版的兼容性。

## Introduction 

A Riru / Zygisk module trying to provide an ART hooking framework which delivers consistent APIs with the OG Xposed, leveraging LSPlant hooking framework.

> Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs. That's great because it means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without any changes (as long as the original code was not changed too much). It's also easy to undo. As all changes are done in the memory, you just need to deactivate the module and reboot to get your original system back. There are many other advantages, but here is just one more: multiple modules can do changes to the same part of the system or app. With modified APKs, you have to choose one. No way to combine them, unless the author builds multiple APKs with different combinations.

## Supported Versions

## For Developers

Developers are welcome to write Xposed modules with hooks based on LSPosed Framework. A module based on LSPosed framework is fully compatible with the original Xposed Framework, and vice versa, a Xposed Framework-based module will work well with LSPosed framework too.

- [Xposed Framework API](https://api.xposed.info/)

We use our own module repository. We welcome developers to submit modules to our repository, and then modules can be downloaded in LSPosed.
